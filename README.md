# Youtube-DLP Launcher
Small program to launch Youtube-DLP designed so that unskilled users (me) can use this too
Currently comes with minimal but somewhat sufficient functionality
You can also add a shortcut of the .bat file to the Start Menu or to the desktop which was also my main point of writing this 


 # Introduction
Make sure you have the ffmpeg.exe in the same location as yt-dlp.exe (for audio convertion usage)
Place the .bat (or .exe file) in the same directory as yt-dlp.exe
That's it. You can create shortcuts then too

The code is free for everyone, change what you want EXCEPT the title :D
